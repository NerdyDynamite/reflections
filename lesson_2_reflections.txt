What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repository creates a .git folder with the files that are needed for git's 
	commit functionality. Git needs this folder to keep metadata pertaining to the history of 
	the files within the repository.

	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value 
	do you think it offers?

		The staging area is a virtual space that contains the files that will be added to the 
		commit history once the commit command is run. This is different from the working 
		directory and repository because the files there may or may not be committed depending 
		on whether or not they have been added to the staging area. This functionality is 
		useful because not all the files have to be committed, and it is up to the user to 
		decide which to commit. Further down the line, I suspect it will save time when 
		checking out the history of changes within the git interface.
